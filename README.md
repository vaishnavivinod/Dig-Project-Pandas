# Dig-Project-Pandas
The project involves analyzing various aspects of a company called "Dig" using data from different CSV files. The project is divided into several sections, each addressing different questions and scenarios related to the company's operations:

**New Product Analytics**: In this section, the project explores the possibility of launching a new line of drinks at a restaurant within the "Dig" chain. The goal is to identify the best restaurant and month to launch the new product. This involves analyzing data to find which restaurant has the highest average number of drink orders and determining the most suitable month for the launch.
**The Next Frontier**: This part focuses on the development of a new delivery service for "Dig." The project aims to design a delivery-specific menu. Questions include identifying the most popular main, base, main-base combinations, and understanding the relationships with different sides.
**Finding Fertile Ground For a New Delivery Service**: This section involves finding the most suitable restaurant to pilot the new delivery service based on the popularity of deliveries at different locations. The goal is to identify the restaurant with the highest percentage of delivery orders and consider it as a pilot location for the new service.
**Understanding Your Customers**: Are Salad eaters Healthier?: This part investigates whether customers who choose a salad as a base are indeed healthier eaters. It explores the relationship between salad-based orders, cookie orders, and side choices to determine whether salad-based choices correlate with healthier eating habits.
**Orders and Weather**: The final analysis looks into the relationship between order patterns and weather conditions. It examines whether the proportion of delivery orders depends on the season and whether the temperature outside affects the number of drinks customers order. This information can be used for staffing, promotional efforts, and product launches.
**Throughout the project, various data manipulation and analysis techniques are used, including data merging, grouping, statistical calculations, and data visualization. The project demonstrates the application of data analysis skills to real-world business scenarios and provides insights that can influence decision-making processes.**
